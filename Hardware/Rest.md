### NX DMX

NX DMX is a USB powered 2 port DMX Node. As a member of the innovative ONYX platform from Obsidian Control Systems the NX DMX provides instant access to DMX In and Outputs as well as RDM communication. The device is plug and play and requires no drivers or additional configuration to integrate with ONYX. It is designed to work with any PC but also works with any ONYX console as a fast and affordable way to add two additional DMX ports.

NX DMX supports ONYX on PC systems for up to four Universes without any dedicated license. When connected to an ONYX licensed PC or ONYX console the NX DMX is assignable to any one of 255 Universes.

NX DMX allows for the full ONYX system to be used in many situations, from small events and tradeshows to clubs and churches. Many technicians utilize ONYX through the NX DMX as an affordable but powerful test station due to ONYX' outstanding library support.
